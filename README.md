<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <header> <h1>Jarir Bookstore Mobile Application Project</h1> </header> <section> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Jarir Bookstore is a popular retail chain in the [Middle East] that offers a wide range of products, including books, electronics, and office supplies. The [Jarir Bookstore] [mobile app] is an essential tool for the company as it allows customers to browse and purchase products from their mobile devices.</p>
  
 <h2>Problem</h2>
	<p>In the past, if a customer wanted to buy a specific product from Jarir Bookstore, they had to visit the store themselves and search for the availability of the product, causing inconvenience and wasting time. There was also difficulty in comparing products in terms of prices and specifications, and knowing what was new.</p>
	<section>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Jarir Bookstore is a well-established brand with a loyal customer base in the Middle East. However, the company may face competition from online retailers and e-book platforms. Developing a mobile application can help Jarir Bookstore stay competitive and provide a modern, convenient shopping experience for customers.</p>
	<section>
	<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
	<p>To address these problems, the Jarir application has been developed to be a pioneering and distinctive application that combines several products, including electronic products, books, and more. Customers can browse many categories of products, order them online, and have them delivered to their homes, saving time and effort for the customer and also in the field of product marketing for companies.</p>
